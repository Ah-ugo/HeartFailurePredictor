# Heart Failure Predictor

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for an estimated 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a major CVD and is characterized by insufficient blood ouput. The capacity to predict which patients are at higher risks of poor survival is essential to offer the optimal care to each patient. In this project, we will therefore use clinical data collected from patients with heart failure and attempt to predict outcome. We will compare multiple classifiers to find a high accuracy model.
